_Luna Paint_ is a VS Code extension that lets you edit raster images from within the editor, just open an image from the explorer and start editing like any other file.

> âš  This is a preview release:
> - Some features you expect from an image editor may be missing or limited.
> - Hot exit state may break when the extension updates as the data format gets refined.
> - If you hit any problems or want to request a feature, please [create an issue on the repo](https://github.com/lunapaint/vscode-luna-paint).
